Hello!

To use this script, please fill in the data.csv file with the following columns:

Broker; Name; Ticker; Average Buy Value; Number of shares; Total value

You can find the ticker symbols on Yahoo Finance at https://finance.yahoo.com/ or simply search on Google. For example, if you're looking for Apple, search "Apple US Yahoo Finance ticker" and you'll find something like "AAPL".

The main objective of this script is to generate a .json file containing statistics about your portfolio (which is very helpful if you have investments across multiple brokers).

In the future, I plan to use the generated .json files to create a graph showing the history of my portfolio. I'll publish it as soon as possible and continue to improve it.

If you have any suggestions for new statistics, I'm open to them and would be happy to incorporate them.

Thanks! :)
